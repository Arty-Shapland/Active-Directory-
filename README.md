# Active Directory

## Objective

This project simulates a small enterprise Active Directory environment built entirely in VirtualBox. It aims to deploy and secure a Windows Server 2022 domain controller with Sysmon and Splunk forwarding for centralized logging and alerting. A Windows 10 domain-joined endpoint is configured with Sysmon, Splunk forwarding, and Atomic Red Team to generate attack telemetry, while a Kali Linux system is used to emulate adversary activity. All systems are interconnected through a virtual router and switch to replicate realistic network segmentation and monitoring.
